## Project
 An Iterative Development Projects is a website development process involves designing, coding, deployment, and testing components of the application. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. 
 
Developers frequently create  of their work for stakeholders review, rather than waiting [Private Preview Website](preview.md) until the end of development to find any problems. 

<!--
Other defect detection mechanisms built into Iterative Development are:

- [VScode](vscode.md) editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

- [VScode](vscode.md) fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes, and any runtime errors while editing
